## Weather App
This is the code repository of the Android/iOS Weather App. The Weather App uses [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org) API to get the realtime weather statistics.

The source code is **100% Dart**, and everything resides in the [/lib](https://github.com/ShivamGoyal1899/WeatherApp/tree/master/lib) folder.
